## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

For this project, I proposed a feature that allows users to take a 360° virtual tour of the exhibits at the Eiteljorg Museum.

### Core Webpages

**Exhibit Grid Page**
  - Displays a grid of exhibit cards. Each card contains an image, title, and description of the exhibit.
  - When users hover over a card, the image dims and an eye icon appears.
  - Clicking a card redirects the user to a specific virtual tour for that exhibit or room.

**Virtual Tour Page**
  - Features a 360° interactive view of a museum room.
  - Users can rotate, zoom, and move through the space.
  - Additional hotspots may be used to jump between exhibits or rooms.

### Design Choices

**Styling Inspiration**
  - Inspired by the children’s museum or the indianapolis public libaray.
  - Apartment virtual tour websites were also used as references for the 360° functionality.

**Color Palette**
  -I will just keep the color plate they already have on their website now.

**Tags and Categories**
  - Exhibits will be organized by category for each room.clustering exhibits by theme or room.
  - Tags help users filter or search by interest to find indivisual exhibits that fall under a tag.
